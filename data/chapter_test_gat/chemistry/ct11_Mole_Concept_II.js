    text: "Which of the following statement with respect to limiting reagent is NOT correct?",
    options: {
      A: "It limits the formation of product",
      B: "It is always a byproduct of a reaction",
      C: "It is always 100% consumed in a reaction",
      D: "It limits the rate of chemical reaction"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "A limiting reagent is a reactant, not a byproduct. It gets completely consumed and limits product formation."

    text: "Determine the molarity of a solution when 49 g of H₂SO₄ is dissolved in 250 mL of water.",
    options: {
      A: "3 M",
      B: "4 M",
      C: "1 M",
      D: "2 M"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Moles of H₂SO₄ = 49/98 = 0.5 moles. Volume = 0.25 L. Molarity = 0.5/0.25 = 2 M."

    text: "How many grams of Ca(OH)₂ contains 36 g of oxygen? (Ca = 40, H = 1, O = 16)",
    options: {
      A: "70.25 g",
      B: "78.75 g",
      C: "83.25 g",
      D: "81.25 g"
    },
    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "32 g of oxygen corresponds to 74 g of Ca(OH)₂. Therefore, 36 g of oxygen corresponds to 83.25 g of Ca(OH)₂."

    text: "Which of the following has a different number of particles?",
    options: {
      A: "80 g of oxygen",
      B: "71 g of chlorine",
      C: "70 g of nitrogen",
      D: "115 g of sodium"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "71 g of chlorine corresponds to 2 moles, while the others correspond to 5 moles each. Hence, chlorine has a different number of particles."

    text: "Given 2 moles of methane and 4 moles of oxygen in the reaction CH₄ + O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O, which statement is correct?",
    options: {
      A: "CH₄ is the limiting reagent",
      B: "O₂ is the limiting reagent",
      C: "2 moles of H₂O will be produced",
      D: "1 mole of CO₂ will be produced"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Based on stoichiometric ratios, methane has the smaller ratio and hence acts as the limiting reagent."

      D: "47.6%"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Percentage of sodium = (2 × 23 / 106) × 100 = 43.3%."

    id: 7,
    text: "How many moles of HNO₃ contain 12 g of oxygen?",
    options: {
      A: "0.25 moles",
      B: "0.45 moles",
      C: "0.75 moles",
      D: "0.38 moles"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "48 g of oxygen is present in 63 g of HNO₃. Therefore, 12 g of oxygen corresponds to 0.25 moles of HNO₃."

    text: "Which element has the highest percentage composition in CaCO₃?",
    options: {
      A: "Carbon",
      B: "Oxygen",
      C: "Calcium",
      D: "Both calcium and carbon"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Oxygen contributes 48% by mass in CaCO₃, which is the highest among its constituent elements."
