    text: "Which of the following changes will be digestion of food?",
    options: {
      A: "Ordinary Change",
      B: "Chemical Change",
      C: "Physical Change",
      D: "Complex Change"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Digestion of food involves chemical reactions that convert complex food into simpler substances. Hence, it is a chemical change. Correct option is (B)."

    text: "Which of the following is a physical change?",
    options: {
      A: "Boiling of water",
      B: "Bending of pipe",
      C: "Shredding of paper",
      D: "All of the above"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Boiling, bending, and shredding involve changes in physical properties without changing composition. Hence, all are physical changes. Correct option is (D)."

    text: "The process in which a layer of zinc is deposited on iron is known as",
    options: {
      A: "Galvanisation",
      B: "Rusting",
      C: "Alloying",
      D: "Crystallisation"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Depositing a protective layer of zinc on iron to prevent rusting is called galvanisation. Hence, the correct option is (A)."

    text: "Which of the following is not a characteristic of chemical change?",
    options: {
      A: "Change in colour",
      B: "Change in state",
      C: "Liberation of gas",
      D: "Production of sound"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Change in state is generally a characteristic of physical change, not chemical change. Hence, the correct option is (B)."

    text: "What happens when steam is condensed?",
    options: {
      A: "New substance is formed",
      B: "No new substance is formed",
      C: "Gaseous phase changes to liquid",
      D: "Both (b) and (c)"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Condensation does not form a new substance and changes steam from gas to liquid. Hence, the correct option is (D)."

    text: "What changes is/are observed when an apple slice is exposed to the surrounding air?",
    options: {
      A: "Undergoes oxidation and turns brown",
      B: "Brown colour appears due to a chemical reaction between air and enzyme",
      C: "Both (a) and (b)",
      D: "None of the above"
    },
    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Apple slices turn brown due to oxidation caused by a chemical reaction between oxygen and enzymes. Hence, both statements are correct. Option (C)."

    id: 7,
    text: "A change in state from one form to another depicts a ____ change.",
    options: {
      A: "Physical",
      B: "Chemical",
      C: "Biological",
      D: "None of the Above"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Change in state does not alter chemical composition, so it is a physical change. Hence, the correct option is (A)."

    text: "Which of the following methods is used to prevent rusting?",
    options: {
      A: "Painting",
      B: "Oiling",
      C: "Galvanisation",
      D: "All of the above"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Painting, oiling, and galvanisation all protect iron from exposure to air and moisture. Hence, the correct option is (D)."

    id: 9,
    text: "Which of the following is/are a chemical change?",
    options: {
      A: "Burning of coal",
      B: "Formation of curd",
      C: "Melting of ice",
      D: "Both (a) and (b)"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Burning of coal and formation of curd both involve formation of new substances, so they are chemical changes. Hence, option (D)."
