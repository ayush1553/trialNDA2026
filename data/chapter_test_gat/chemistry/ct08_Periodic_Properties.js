    text: "Who was the first scientist who attempted and established the stepping stone towards classifying elements?",
    options: {
      A: "John Newland",
      B: "Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev",
      C: "Henry Moseley",
      D: "Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner first attempted the classification of elements by forming triads, which became the stepping stone towards the modern periodic table."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    text: "Which of the following is NOT a Döbereiner triad?",
    options: {
      A: "N, Ca, Cl",
      B: "Pt, Ag, Ca",
      C: "P, Sr, Br",
      D: "As, Ba, I"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Pt, Ag and Ca do not satisfy Döbereiner’s triad rule, whereas the other sets are valid triads."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    text: "Which of the following is NOT correct regarding Döbereiner’s classification of elements?",
    options: {
      A: "Elements were classified into groups of three called triads",
      B: "It holds true for all the existing elements at that time",
      C: "Classification was based on average atomic mass",
      D: "Only three triads were formed"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Döbereiner’s classification was applicable only to a few elements and not to all known elements."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    text: "What was the basis of classification used by John Newlands?",
    options: {
      A: "Atomic mass",
      B: "Atomic number",
      C: "Mass number",
      D: "Average mass"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "John Newlands arranged elements in increasing order of atomic mass according to the law of octaves."
  },
  {
    id: 11,
    text: "Who discovered the inert gases which became a major limitation of Newlands’ law of octaves?",
    options: {
      A: "Alfred Werner",
      B: "Sir William Ramsay",
      C: "Paul Sabatier",
      D: "Adolf von Baeyer"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Sir William Ramsay discovered the inert gases, which could not be accommodated in Newlands’ law of octaves."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    text: "Which of the following were drawbacks of Newlands’ classification?\n1. Law of octaves held only up to calcium\n2. Ni and Co were placed with halogens\n3. Fe was placed far away from Ni and Co",
    options: {
      A: "1 only",
      B: "1 and 2 only",
      C: "1, 2 and 3",
      D: "2 and 3 only"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Newlands’ law was valid only up to calcium and incorrectly placed Ni and Co with halogens."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    text: "Which statement regarding Newlands’ classification is NOT true?",
    options: {
      A: "Classification was based on atomic mass",
      B: "After every eight elements properties repeated",
      C: "Law of octaves was followed only till calcium",
      D: "Newlands classified 56 elements"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "According to Newlands, properties repeat after every seventh element, not the eighth."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    text: "Which scientist first introduced the concept of groups and periods?",
    options: {
      A: "Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev",
      B: "John Newlands",
      C: "Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner",
      D: "Henry Moseley"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Mendeleev introduced the systematic arrangement of elements into groups and periods."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    text: "Who is known as the father of the periodic table?",
    options: {
      A: "John Newlands",
      B: "Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev",
      C: "Henry Moseley",
      D: "Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
