    text: "Who was the first scientist who attempted and established the stepping stone towards classifying elements?",
    options: {
      A: "John Newland",
      B: "Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev",
      C: "Henry Moseley",
      D: "Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner first attempted the classification of elements by forming triads, which became the stepping stone toward the modern periodic table."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    text: "Which of the following is NOT a Döbereiner triad?",
    options: {
      A: "N, Ca, Cl",
      B: "Pt, Ag, Ca",
      C: "P, Sr, Br",
      D: "As, Ba, I"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Pt, Ag and Ca do not satisfy Döbereiner’s triad rule, whereas the other sets are valid triads identified by Döbereiner."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    text: "Which of the following is NOT correct regarding Döbereiner’s classification of elements?",
    options: {
      A: "Elements were classified into groups of three called triads",
      B: "It holds true for all the existing elements at that time",
      C: "Classification was based on the average atomic mass of the triad",
      D: "Only three triads were formed"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Döbereiner’s classification did not hold true for all known elements; it was applicable only to a few elements."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    text: "What was the basis of classification used by John Newlands?",
    options: {
      A: "Atomic mass",
      B: "Atomic number",
      C: "Mass number",
      D: "Average mass"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "John Newlands classified elements on the basis of increasing atomic mass according to the law of octaves."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    text: "What was the range of elements Newlands was able to classify?",
    options: {
      A: "From hydrogen to thorium",
      B: "From hydrogen to calcium",
      C: "From hydrogen to potassium",
      D: "From hydrogen to strontium"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Newlands arranged elements from hydrogen to thorium (56 elements), although the law of octaves was valid only up to calcium."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    text: "Which of the following were drawbacks of Newlands’ classification?\n1. It holds the law of octaves only up to calcium.\n2. He placed Ni and Co with halogens.\n3. Fe, similar to Ni and Co, was placed away from them.",
    options: {
      A: "1 only",
      B: "1 and 2 only",
      C: "1, 2 and 3",
      D: "2 and 3 only"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Newlands’ classification followed the law of octaves only up to calcium and wrongly placed Ni and Co with halogens."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    text: "Which statement regarding Newlands’ basis of classification is NOT true?",
    options: {
      A: "Elements were classified on the basis of atomic mass",
      B: "After every eight elements, properties repeated",
      C: "The law of octaves was followed only till calcium",
      D: "Using the law, Newlands classified 56 elements"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "According to Newlands, properties repeated after every seventh element, not after every eighth element."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    text: "Which scientist was the first to introduce the concept of groups and periods?",
    options: {
      A: "Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev",
      B: "John Newlands",
      C: "Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner",
      D: "Henry Moseley"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Mendeleev introduced the systematic arrangement of elements into groups and periods."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    text: "What was the basis of classification used in Mendeleev’s periodic table?",
    options: {
      A: "Atomic mass and similarity of physical properties",
      B: "Atomic number and similarity of chemical properties",
      C: "Atomic number and similarity of physical properties",
      D: "Atomic mass and similarity of chemical properties"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Mendeleev classified elements based on increasing atomic mass and similarity in chemical properties."
  },
