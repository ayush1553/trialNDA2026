    text: "Which of the following reaction is not in accordance with the Law of conservation of mass?",
    options: {
      A: "C + 2O₂ → 2CO₂",
      B: "2N₂ + O₂ → 2N₂O",
      C: "2S + 2O₂ → 2SO₂",
      D: "2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "In the reaction C + 2O₂ → 2CO₂, the total mass of reactants does not equal the total mass of products. Hence, it violates the Law of conservation of mass."

    text: "Which law states that each compound has a fixed formula irrespective of its source from which it is made?",
    options: {
      A: "Law of chemical composition",
      B: "Law of conservation of mass",
      C: "Avogadro’s hypothesis",
      D: "Law of constant proportion"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "The Law of Constant Proportion states that a compound always contains the same elements in a fixed ratio by mass, irrespective of its source."

    id: 5,
    text: "Which of the following statements holds true with respect to the Law of conservation of mass?\n1. Total mass of reactants equals total mass of products.\n2. It was discovered by Antoine Lavoisier.\n3. Its limitation is radioactive reactions.",
    options: {
      A: "1 only",
      B: "1, 2 and 3 only",
      C: "1 and 3 only",
      D: "1 and 2 only"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "All three statements are correct. The law was proposed by Antoine Lavoisier and does not hold true in radioactive reactions."

    text: "At constant temperature, two gases V₁ and V₂ have volumes such that V₁ > V₂. Which gas will exert more pressure on the walls of the container?",
    options: {
      A: "V₁",
      B: "Pressure is independent of volume",
      C: "Both exert same pressure",
      D: "V₂"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "According to Boyle’s law, pressure is inversely proportional to volume at constant temperature. Hence, the gas with smaller volume (V₂) exerts more pressure."

    text: "“In CH₄, even if carbon and hydrogen are from different sources, they always combine in the same proportion.” Which law explains this?",
    options: {
      A: "Law of constant proportion",
      B: "Law of multiple proportion",
      C: "Law of conservation of mass",
      D: "Law of conservation of energy"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "The Law of Constant Proportion states that elements in a compound always combine in a fixed ratio by mass, irrespective of their source."

    id: 8,
    text: "What is the nature of the graph between pressure and volume according to Boyle’s law?",
    options: {
      A: "Parabolic",
      B: "Hyperbolic",
      C: "Straight line through origin",
      D: "Straight line parallel to x-axis"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "According to Boyle’s law, pressure is inversely proportional to volume, resulting in a rectangular hyperbola on a P–V graph."
