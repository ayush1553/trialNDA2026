    text: "When hydrogen reacts with oxygen to form water, what is the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen by volume in the balanced equation?",
    options: {
      A: "1 : 2",
      B: "1 : 1",
      C: "2 : 1",
      D: "1 : 4"
    },
    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Balanced equation: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O. Hence the volume ratio of H₂ : O₂ is 2 : 1."
