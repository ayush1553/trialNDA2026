    text: "If a body is moved from the poles to the equator, its weight",
    options: {
      A: "Increases",
      B: "Decreases",
      C: "Remains constant",
      D: "None of the above"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Weight is maximum at the poles and minimum at the equator due to Earth's rotation and shape. Hence, when moved from poles to equator, weight decreases. Correct option is (B)."

    text: "What is the universal law of gravitation?",
    options: {
      A: "Objects attract each other with a force proportional to their masses",
      B: "Objects attract each other with a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them",
      C: "Objects repel each other with a force proportional to their masses",
      D: "Objects repel each other with a force inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "According to Newton’s universal law of gravitation, force between two masses is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Hence, the correct option is (B)."

    text: "The gravitational force between two objects will decrease if",
    options: {
      A: "The masses of the objects increase",
      B: "The distance between the objects decreases",
      C: "The distance between the objects increases",
      D: "The masses of the objects decrease"
    },
    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between objects. Increasing distance decreases force. Hence, the correct option is (C)."

    text: "The escape velocity from a planet depends on",
    options: {
      A: "The mass of the planet",
      B: "The radius of the planet",
      C: "Both the mass and the radius of the planet",
      D: "None of the above"
    },
    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Escape velocity depends on both the mass and radius of the planet as vₑ = √(2GM/R). Hence, the correct option is (C)."

    text: "Which of the following best describes the gravitational force acting between two objects?",
    options: {
      A: "It is a contact force",
      B: "It is a long-range force",
      C: "It is an electromagnetic force",
      D: "It is a nuclear force"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Gravitational force acts over large distances without physical contact, so it is a long-range force. Hence, the correct option is (B)."
