    text: "Two particles of masses m₁ and m₂ are lying in the XY plane at (0,0) and (d,0) respectively. If the distances of the center of mass from m₁ and m₂ are d₁ and d₂, which relation is correct?",
    options: {
      A: "d₁m₁ = d₂m₂",
      B: "d₁m₂ = d₂m₁",
      C: "d₁/m₁ = d₂/m₂",
      D: "d₁/m₂ = d₂/m₁"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "For two-particle systems, the center of mass satisfies m₁d₁ = m₂d₂. Rearranging gives d₁m₂ = d₂m₁. Hence, the correct option is (B)."

    text: "A firecracker projected moves along a parabolic path and explodes somewhere in its flight. The center of mass of the fragments will",
    options: {
      A: "Move along the horizontal direction",
      B: "Move along the vertical direction",
      C: "Continue to move along the same parabolic path",
      D: "Move in a random direction"
    },
    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Since no external force acts on the system, the center of mass continues to move along the same parabolic path. Hence, the correct option is (C)."

    text: "Two particles of equal masses move along the same straight line with equal speed in opposite directions. What is the speed of the center of mass?",
    options: {
      A: "0 m/s",
      B: "1 m/s",
      C: "0.5 m/s",
      D: "2 m/s"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Equal masses moving with equal speeds in opposite directions result in zero net momentum. Hence, the center of mass remains at rest. Correct option is (A)."

    text: "A ball rolling down an inclined plane has",
    options: {
      A: "Only translational motion",
      B: "Only rotational motion",

      D: "Neither translational nor rotational motion"
    },
    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "A rolling body undergoes translation of its center of mass and rotation about its axis. Hence, the correct option is (C)."

    text: "A person stands on a rotating platform at 0.90 rev/s. When he raises his arms, the rotation rate becomes 0.60 rev/s. By what factor does his moment of inertia change?",
    options: {
      A: "0.6",
      B: "0.25",

      D: "1.5"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Using conservation of angular momentum, I₁ω₁ = I₂ω₂. Hence, I₂/I₁ = 0.90/0.60 = 1.5. Correct option is (D)."

    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "In rotational motion, torque plays the same role as force in translational motion. Hence, the correct option is (D)."

    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,

    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Torque = rF. For first case τ₁ = rF, for second τ₂ = (r/2)×2F = rF. Hence τ₁ : τ₂ = 1 : 1. Correct option is (B)."

    text: "An ice skater pulls her arms close while spinning. What happens to her angular momentum and kinetic energy?",
    options: {
      A: "Increases, increases",
      B: "Increases, remains constant",
      C: "Remains constant, increases",

    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "With no external torque, angular momentum remains constant. Decrease in moment of inertia increases angular velocity and hence kinetic energy. Correct option is (C)."
