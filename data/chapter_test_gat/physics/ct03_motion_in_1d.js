    text: "A ball is thrown vertically upward. What is the magnitude of velocity and acceleration at the highest point respectively?",
    options: {

    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "At the highest point, the velocity of the ball becomes zero, but acceleration due to gravity still acts downward with magnitude g. Hence, the correct option is (D)."

    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Statement 3 is incorrect because displacement is always less than or equal to distance. Hence, the correct option is (B)."
