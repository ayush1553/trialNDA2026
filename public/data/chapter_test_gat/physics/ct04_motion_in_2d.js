      D: "The direction parallel to both vectors"
    },
    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "The vector product (cross product) of two vectors results in a vector that is perpendicular to both original vectors, as given by the right-hand rule. Hence, the correct option is (C)."

    text: "When a particle moves in a circle that describes equal angles at equal times then its velocity vector",
    options: {
      A: "Remains constant",
      B: "Changes in magnitude",
      C: "Changes in direction",
      D: "Changes both in magnitude and direction"

    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "In circular motion with constant angular velocity, speed remains constant but direction of velocity changes continuously. Hence, the correct option is (C)."

    text: "Two bodies with masses of 20 kg and 9 kg, whose periods are identical, revolve in concentric orbits with radii R and r. The ratio of their centripetal acceleration then is",

      A: "R/r",
      B: "r/R",

      D: "r²/R²"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "For identical periods, centripetal acceleration is proportional to radius. Hence, the ratio of centripetal accelerations is R/r. Correct option is (A)."

    text: "A stone of mass m is tied to a string of length l and rotated in a circle with constant speed v. If the string is released, the stone flies",

      B: "Radially inward",
      C: "Tangentially outward",
      D: "With an acceleration 2mv/l"
    },
    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "When the string is released, the centripetal force vanishes and the stone moves along the tangent to the circular path. Hence, the correct option is (C)."

    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Using A·B = |A||B|cosθ, cosθ = 6/(3×4) = 1/2, hence θ = 60°. Therefore, the correct option is (B)."

    text: "A body is traveling at a constant speed in a circle. It has",
    options: {
      A: "A constant velocity",

      D: "An acceleration that varies with time"
    },
    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "In uniform circular motion, speed is constant and centripetal acceleration has constant magnitude though its direction changes. Hence, the correct option is (C)."

    text: "If one bullet is fired horizontally and one falls from the same height, they will hit the ground",
    options: {
      A: "One after the other",

    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Both bullets have the same vertical motion under gravity and hence reach the ground at the same time. Therefore, the correct option is (B)."

    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Horizontal velocity remains 4.9 m/s. Vertical velocity becomes 9.8t. Equating gives t = 0.5 s. Hence, the correct option is (B)."
