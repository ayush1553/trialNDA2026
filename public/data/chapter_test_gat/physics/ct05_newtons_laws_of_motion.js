    text: "All are the effects of force except one. Identify the correct alternative.",
    options: {
      A: "Change of motion",
      B: "Change of direction",
      C: "Change of speed",
      D: "Change of mass"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Force can change motion, speed, direction, shape, or size of a body, but it cannot change the mass of a body. Hence, the correct option is (D)."

      A: "1, 2 and 4",
      B: "2, 3 and 5",
      C: "2, 4 and 5",
      D: "1, 3 and 5"
    },
    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Statements 2, 4 and 5 are correct according to the laws of motion. Hence, the correct option is (C)."

    id: 4,
    text: "The S.I unit of impulse is",
    options: {
      A: "N·s",
      B: "kg·m·s⁻¹",
      C: "N·s⁻¹",
      D: "Both (A) and (B)"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Impulse equals change in momentum. Its SI unit is N·s, which is equivalent to kg·m·s⁻¹. Hence, the correct option is (D)."

  {
    id: 5,
    text: "Which of the following is not an example of contact force?",
    options: {
      A: "Frictional force",
      B: "Muscular force",
      C: "Tension force",
      D: "Gravitational force"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Gravitational force acts without physical contact and is a non-contact force. Hence, the correct option is (D)."

  {
    id: 6,
    text: "Two bodies A and B of mass 2 kg and 10 kg are applied by an equal force for the same duration. Which observation is correct?",
    options: {
      A: "Body A has larger inertia than B",
      B: "Body B has larger inertia than A",
      C: "Both the bodies have same inertia",
      D: "Inertia is independent of mass"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Inertia is directly proportional to mass. Since body B has larger mass, it has larger inertia. Hence, the correct option is (B)."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    text: "A ball thrown upward in a train moving with uniform velocity",
    options: {
      A: "falls behind the thrower",
      B: "falls in front of the thrower",
      C: "returns to the thrower in the actual position",
      D: "remains floated"
    },
    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Due to inertia of motion, the ball retains the horizontal motion of the train and returns to the thrower. Hence, the correct option is (C)."

  {
    id: 8,
    text: "Find the magnitude of force required to stop a vehicle of mass 5000 kg in 10 seconds moving with a speed of 54 km/h.",
    options: {
      A: "7500 N",
      B: "8000 N",
      C: "10000 N",
      D: "5500 N"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Using F = ma with retardation of 1.5 m/s², the force required is 7500 N. Hence, the correct option is (A)."
