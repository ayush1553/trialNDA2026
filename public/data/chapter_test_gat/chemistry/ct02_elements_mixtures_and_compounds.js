    text: "Which of the following properties is not true for matter?",
    options: {
      A: "Occupy space",
      B: "Have mass",
      C: "Have fixed length",
      D: "None of the above"
    },
    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Matter is defined as anything that has mass and occupies space. It does not necessarily have a fixed length. Hence, the correct option is (C)."

    text: "The oxides of non-metals are ____ in nature.",
    options: {
      A: "Basic",
      B: "Acidic",
      C: "Neutral",
      D: "None of the above"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Oxides of non-metals generally form acids when dissolved in water. Hence, they are acidic in nature. Correct option is (B)."

      D: "Steam distillation"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "p-nitrophenol and o-nitrophenol can be separated using steam distillation due to differences in hydrogen bonding. Hence, the correct option is (D)."

    text: "Among different states of matter, which state has strongly packed molecules?",
    options: {
      A: "Solid",
      B: "Liquid",
      C: "Gas",
      D: "All are equal"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "In solids, particles are closely packed with strong intermolecular forces. Hence, the correct option is (A)."

    text: "The reactive metals will have _____ ionisation energy.",
    options: {
      A: "Low",
      B: "High",
      C: "Neither too low nor too high",
      D: "None of the above"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Reactive metals easily lose electrons, so they have low ionisation energy. Hence, the correct option is (A)."

      C: "Boiling",
      D: "Filtering"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Volatile solids that change directly from solid to gas are separated using sublimation. Hence, the correct option is (B)."

    text: "What is the other name of pseudo solids?",
    options: {
      A: "Amorphous solids",
      B: "Crystalline solids",
      C: "Metallic solids",
      D: "Non-metallic solids"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Pseudo solids are also known as amorphous solids because they lack long-range order. Hence, the correct option is (A)."
