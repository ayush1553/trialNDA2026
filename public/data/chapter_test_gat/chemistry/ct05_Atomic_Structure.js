    text: "If alpha particles are directed towards atoms, only a small number of them (in the order of one in a million) are deflected, while the majority pass through without deviation. What is the most likely reason?",
    options: {
      A: "The force of repulsion exerted by alpha particles on atoms is weak",
      B: "The attraction between alpha particles and electrons is minimal",
      C: "There are many electrons surrounding the single nucleus",
      D: "The volume occupied by the nucleus is much smaller compared to the overall size of the atom"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Most alpha particles pass through the atom without deflection because the nucleus occupies a very small volume compared to the overall size of the atom. Only those that come close to the nucleus are deflected."

    text: "Which of the following atomic models differs from Thomson’s atomic model?",
    options: {
      A: "Watermelon model",
      B: "Plum pudding model",
      C: "Raisin pudding model",
      D: "Nuclear model"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "The Nuclear model proposed by Rutherford differs from Thomson’s model. The other models listed are variations of Thomson’s plum pudding model."

    text: "Which of the following statements is incorrect?",
    options: {
      A: "Atom sizes in Thomson’s and Rutherford’s models are of the same order of magnitude",
      B: "Electrons are in stable equilibrium in Thomson’s model, but always feel a net force in Rutherford’s model",
      C: "Thomson’s model predicts the collapse of a classical atom",
      D: "The positively charged part possesses most of the mass in both models"
    },
    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Thomson’s model does not predict the collapse of a classical atom. The collapse issue arises from Rutherford’s model under classical physics."

    options: {
      A: "Blue light",
      B: "Infrared rays",
      C: "Gamma rays",
      D: "Ultraviolet rays"
    },
    correctAnswer: "C",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Gamma rays have the shortest wavelength and highest energy in the electromagnetic spectrum."

    text: "Assertion: The classical theory predicts that the trajectory of an electron in Rutherford’s atomic model would be parabolic.\nReason: Electromagnetic theory suggests that an accelerating charged particle continuously emits radiation.",
    options: {
      A: "Both Assertion and Reason are true and Reason is the correct explanation",
      B: "Both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation",
      C: "Assertion is true, Reason is false",
      D: "Assertion is false, Reason is true"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Classical theory predicts circular orbits with energy loss, not parabolic paths. However, it is true that an accelerating charged particle emits radiation."

    text: "According to Planck’s quantum theory, energy is emitted in:",
    options: {
      A: "Continuous waves",
      B: "Discrete packets",
      C: "Electromagnetic fields",
      D: "Proton beams"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Planck proposed that energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete packets called quanta."

    text: "Which of the following statements is incorrect with respect to a cathode ray discharge tube?",
    options: {
      A: "Protons are present in cathode rays",
      B: "The path of cathode rays can be deflected by a magnetic field",
      C: "A high voltage is required for the functioning of the tube",
      D: "Cathode rays carry negative charge"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Cathode rays consist of electrons and do not contain protons. Hence, option A is incorrect."

    text: "Which is the lightest particle obtained from hydrogen?",
    options: {
      A: "Electron",
      B: "Proton",
      C: "Neutron",
      D: "Nucleus"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "A hydrogen atom contains one proton in its nucleus. When hydrogen loses its electron, it forms a proton, which is the lightest particle obtained."

    text: "What is the ratio of the mass of a neutron to the mass of an electron?",
    options: {
      A: "1838 times the mass of an electron",
      B: "1/1838 times the mass of an electron",
      C: "1832 times the mass of an electron",
      D: "1/1832 times the mass of an electron"

    text: "Which of the following is NOT a limitation of Thomson’s model of the atom?",
    options: {
      A: "It failed to explain atomic stability",
      B: "It did not mention the nucleus",
      C: "It failed to explain how positive charge holds electrons",
      D: "It concluded that an atom is electrically neutral"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Concluding that an atom is electrically neutral is a contribution, not a limitation, of Thomson’s model."
