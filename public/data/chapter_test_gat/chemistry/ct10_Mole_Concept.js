    text: "Which of the following statements is incorrect with regard to Avogadro’s number?",
    options: {
      A: "It is numerically equal to 1 mole of particles",
      B: "It is the number of particles present in 17 g of fluorine",
      C: "It is the number of particles present in 12 g of C-12 isotope",
      D: "It is the number of particles present in 16 g of oxygen"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Avogadro’s number corresponds to the number of particles in 1 mole. For fluorine, 1 mole corresponds to 19 g, not 17 g."

    text: "On reaction of methane and oxygen, 1 mole of carbon dioxide is formed. What is the minimum mass of oxygen required?",
    options: {
      A: "64 g",
      B: "48 g",
      C: "80 g",
      D: "32 g"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Reaction: CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O. Formation of 1 mole CO₂ requires 2 moles of O₂ = 64 g."

    text: "How many moles of chlorine are present in 142 g of chlorine?",
    options: {
      A: "2 moles",
      B: "4 moles",
      C: "5 moles",
      D: "6 moles"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Atomic mass of chlorine is 35.5 g. Number of moles = 142 ÷ 35.5 = 4 moles."

    text: "What is the mass of a single atom of iron?",
    options: {
      A: "56 g",
      B: "112 g",
      C: "112 μ",
      D: "56 μ"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Mass of a single atom is expressed in atomic mass units (μ). Iron has atomic mass 56, so mass of one atom is 56 μ."

    text: "What is the atomicity of oxygen in phosphoric acid?",
    options: {
      A: "2",
      B: "4",
      C: "5",
      D: "6"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "The formula of phosphoric acid is H₃PO₄. It contains 4 oxygen atoms, so atomicity of oxygen is 4."

    text: "How many moles of oxygen are present in 67.2 L of oxygen gas at STP?",
    options: {
      A: "3 moles",
      B: "5 moles",
      C: "2 moles",
      D: "4 moles"
    },
    correctAnswer: "A",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "At STP, 22.4 L of gas corresponds to 1 mole. Hence, 67.2 ÷ 22.4 = 3 moles."

    text: "What is the molecular mass of benzene?",
    options: {
      A: "72 g",
      B: "78 g",
      C: "76 g",
      D: "80 g"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Benzene has formula C₆H₆. Molecular mass = (6 × 12) + (6 × 1) = 78 g."

    text: "What is the equivalent weight of CaO?",
    options: {
      A: "30 g",
      B: "25 g",
      C: "27 g",
      D: "28 g"
    },
    correctAnswer: "D",
    marks: 4,
    negMarks: -1.33,
    solution: "Molecular mass of CaO = 56 g. n-factor = 2. Equivalent weight = 56 ÷ 2 = 28 g."

    text: "There were 3.5 moles of potassium present. What is its exact mass?",
    options: {
      A: "135 g",
      B: "136.5 g",
      C: "142 g",
      D: "146.5 g"
    },
    correctAnswer: "B",
    marks: 4,
